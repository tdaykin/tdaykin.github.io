{{ "**Some History and Outline:**\n\nOver the 2023 Summer Term from July 4 to August 10, myself, Ebrahim Hussain, Amr Sherif, and Dhruv Arun came together in a team of 4 for the annual ENPH 253 robot competition. The final robot photos above represent all of our unique contributions and our less than straightforward path which led us to our final design. This post highlights our conceptual ideas, decisions, and the manufacturing of our robot. We concluded the term with a 2nd-place finish.\n\n- The full race can be watched [here](https://www.youtube.com/live/gXMnazr8vEo?si=DzM_r1Ch8ZJGJhDZ)." | markdownify }}

**The Track:**

{{ "**Summary of Rules:**\n\n- Heats are 2 minutes long.\n- Robots score points by picking up prize blocks (labelled “Bonus”) on the track, coins (labelled “Coin”) on the zipline, or by completing a lap. Blocks and coins are worth 1 point each, while a lap is worth 3.\n- Regardless of START(1) or START(2), a lap is counted when a robot completes the following in order:\n  1. Crosses over the finish line.\n  2. Goes up the ramp (blue, top right) and either jumps down on the left side of Rainbow Road or loops around to START(2).\n  3. Travels under Rainbow Road from the left and crosses the finish line again.\n- A magnetic “bomb” is placed on the track, which has the same footprint as a regular Bonus/prize block. Each robot is also allowed to drop one extra bomb on the track at any time throughout the heat.\n  - Any robot that picks up a bomb or tips it on its side has “detonated” the bomb, and they must restart, and also lose -3 points from any existing block/coin points.\n\nThe rules and course webpage can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vS4bQXNVCvEt-UMX50Rsar0Wds5AqRDQToN8ABxkS7ocnluPU8JlCNRYIkiXptbHYsrAI_WKzwC9IwO/pub)." | markdownify }}

  {{ "**Brainstorming:**\n\nTeams were allowed to do almost anything they wanted, including jumping off the ramps, using the zipline, or traveling over the rocks to gain a shortcut to the finish line. However, before talking to each other as a team, we all decided that we would follow tape and dedicate our focus on trying to pick up blocks/avoid them passively.\n\n![Ack vs Diff Steering]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/image/steering253.png)\n\n**Firstly, we needed to choose our steering system.** This is important as it will determine where many elements of the robot will go, such as motors, electronics, and our pickup mechanism. The two types of steering we considered were either Ackermann or Differential..." | markdownify }}
