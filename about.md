## Profile:

My goal is to be a part of the innovative technology scene. Over the recent years I have realized how valuable it is to take initiative on tasks both personal and professional as I have lived the positive impacts it has on goals. I routinely put emphasis on being accountable and meaningful which has given me the ability to lead in competitive environments.

## Education:

### 3rd Year UBC Engineering Physics, BASc
**University Of British Columbia** - Vancouver, B.C., Canada  
*Sept. 2021 -- Present*  
- Engineering Physics is the bridge between Engineering and Science combining advanced concepts in math and physics while putting them to practical use in team-based projects
- Key Courses: software construction, signal processing, mechanics and instrument design

## Technical Experience:

### MEA Process Engineer Co-op, Advanced Manufacturing
**Ballard Power Systems** - Burnaby, B.C., Canada  
*Jan. 2023 -- April. 2023*  
- Applied a structured approach to qualify an upcoming Liquid Injection Molding process; involving data collection, capability/GR\&R analysis, and ultimately, a presentation of results in a lean six sigma environment
- Hands-on experience in operating Liquid Injection Molding machines including troubleshooting and control over molding parameters
- Developed and implemented automated data analysis in excel, transforming raw data into actionable insights; increasing overall efficiency by 98\%
- Accelerated production times by 75% through rapid prototyping of 3D printed fixtures designed in CREO

## Technical Projects:

### Autonomous Robot Competition: 2nd Place
**Technologies:** CAD, Machine Shop, C++  
- Brainstormed, designed, and manufactured an autonomous robot with a group of 4 to race on the same track as other robots all while passively picking up and avoiding certain objects
- Created the entire chassis, ensuring all sensors, circuits and mechanical components function as intended, quickly prototyping drawings into reality by using 3D printers and laser/waterjet cutters
- Implemented and tuned a PID algorithm in C++ so the robot can follow tape smoothly through custom-made tape sensors controlled by an STM-32 Blue Pill

### Nand2Tetris: Project Course
**Technologies:** HDL, Gate logics, Git  
- Designed digital logic circuits using Hardware Description Language (HDL), combining various logic gates and sequentially developing larger components of a modified computer system
- Developed an understanding of computer architecture by building a modified computer system from the NAND gate up; learning knowledge of CPU architecture, ALU design, and memory systems

### Canadian Synthetic Biology Education Research Group, SYNB3
**Technologies:** Python: scikit-learn, NumPy, pandas  
- Assisted in the identification of a cannabinoid that has a high affinity for the human CB1 receptor through simulation together in python and PyMOL
- Visualized protein similarities through hallucinations using python, PyMol and knowledge in organic chemistry
- Produced a technical outline with a multidisciplinary team across Canada that organized and summarized biological findings to satisfy real world demands for potential companies to explore

### Multidisciplinary Undergraduate Research Competition
**Technologies:** R, Statistical Methods: Hypothesis Testing  
- Analyzed and statistically compared market data of air purifiers using R in order to lower costs and increase efficiency and safety of incoming products for COVID-19
- Interpreted how ultraviolet air purifying works, specifically with \( TiO_2 \) together with multi-walled carbon nanotubes, which reduce the harmful effects of UV radiation
- Transformed our findings into digestible content by using python and matplotlib to be shared in a conference

## Technical Skills:

- **Languages:** Python, Java, C/C++, R, MATLAB, LaTeX
- **Developer Tools:** Visual Studio, IntelliJ, Git
- **Libraries:** pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, scikit-learn

## Community Engagement:

### Undergraduate Research
**Advisor: Arman Hejazi, UBC Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering** - Vancouver B.C.  
*Sept. 2021 -- Aug. 2022*  
- Published an abstract with our findings
- Advanced my knowledge in research by understanding how to read/write technical documents and give presentations to a variety of audiences

### Engineering Physics Mentor
**University of British Columbia** - Vancouver, B.C.  
*Sept. 2023 -- Present*
- Guided 5 first-year students in Engineering Physics, providing academic support and career advice
- Developed strong leadership and teaching skills through this role

## Publications and Conferences:

### Multidisciplinary Undergraduate Research Competition (MURC)
**University of British Columbia** - Vancouver, B.C.  
*March 2020*  

- Lead a multidisciplinary team as we discovered innovations in air purification which evolved into authoring an abstract and representing our findings in a non-technical presentation
