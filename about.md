## Profile

My goal is to be a part of the innovative technology scene. Over the recent years I have realized how valuable it is to take initiative on tasks both personal and professional as I have lived the positive impacts it has on goals. I routinely put emphasis on being accountable and meaningful which has given me the ability to lead in competitive environments.

## Education

- **2nd Year UBC Engineering Physics, BASc**  
  University Of British Columbia, Vancouver, B.C.  
  *Sept. 2021 -- Present*  
  - Engineering Physics is the bridge between Engineering and Science combining advanced concepts in math and physics while putting them to practical use in team-based projects
  - Key Courses: software construction, signal processing, mechanics, experimental techniques and design

## Technical Experience

- **MEA Process Engineer Co-op, Advanced Manufacturing**  
  Ballard Power Systems, Burnaby, B.C.  
  *Jan. 2023 -- April. 2023*  
  - Applied a structured approach to qualify one of the most critical future manufacturing processes; involving data collection, analysis, and ultimately, a presentation of results
  - Hands-on experience in operating Liquid Injection Molding machines including troubleshooting and control over molding parameters
  - Developed and implemented automated data analysis, transforming raw data into actionable insights increasing overall efficiency by 98%
  - Accelerated production times by 75% through rapid prototyping of 3D printed fixtures designed in CREO
  
## Technical Projects

- **Autonomous Robot Competition: 2nd Place**  
  CAD, Machine Shop, C++
  - Brainstormed, designed and manufactured an autonomous robot with a group of 4 to race on the same track as other robots all while passively picking up and avoiding certain objects
  - Created the entire chassis ensuring all sensors, circuits, wiring and mechanical components function as intended, quickly prototyping drawings into reality by using 3D printers, laser/waterjet cutters, and lathes
  - Implemented and tuned a PID algorithm in C++ so the robot can follow tape smoothly through custom made tape sensors controlled by an STM-32 Blue Pill
