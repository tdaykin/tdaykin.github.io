## Profile:

My goal is to be a part of the innovative technology scene. Over the recent years I have realized how valuable it is to take initiative on tasks both personal and professional as I have lived the positive impacts it has on goals. I routinely put emphasis on being accountable and meaningful which has given me the ability to lead in competitive environments.

## Education:

### 3rd Year UBC Engineering Physics, BASc
**University Of British Columbia** - Vancouver, B.C.  
*Sept. 2021 -- Present*  
- Engineering Physics is the bridge between Engineering and Science combining advanced concepts in math and physics while putting them to practical use in team-based projects
- Key Courses: software construction, signal processing, mechanics, experimental techniques and design

## Technical Experience:

### MEA Process Engineer Co-op, Advanced Manufacturing
**Ballard Power Systems** - Burnaby, B.C.  
*Jan. 2023 -- April. 2023*  
- Applied a structured approach to qualify one of the most critical future manufacturing processes; involving data collection, analysis, and ultimately, a presentation of results
- Hands-on experience in operating Liquid Injection Molding machines including troubleshooting and control over molding parameters
- Developed and implemented automated data analysis, transforming raw data into actionable insights increasing overall efficiency by 98%
- Accelerated production times by 75% through rapid prototyping of 3D printed fixtures designed in CREO

## Technical Projects:

### Autonomous Robot Competition: 2nd Place
**Technologies:** CAD, Machine Shop, C++  
- Brainstormed, designed, and manufactured an autonomous robot with a group of 4 to race on the same track as other robots all while passively picking up and avoiding certain objects
- Created the entire chassis ensuring all sensors, circuits, wiring, and mechanical components function as intended, quickly prototyping drawings into reality by using 3D printers, laser/waterjet cutters, and lathes
- Implemented and tuned a PID algorithm in C++ so the robot can follow tape smoothly through custom-made tape sensors controlled by an STM-32 Blue Pill

### Nand2Tetris
**Technologies:** HDL, Gate logics, Git  
- Developed a comprehensive understanding of computer architecture by building a computer system from the NAND gate up, involving detailed knowledge of CPU architecture, ALU design, and memory systems
- Acquired hands-on experience in digital logic design using Hardware Description Language (HDL), synthesizing various logic gates and sequentially developing larger components of a computer system, such as Arithmetic Logic Units (ALUs) and Central Processing Units (CPUs)

### Canadian Synthetic Biology Education Research Group, SYNB3
**Technologies:** Python: scikit-learn, NumPy, pandas  
- Successfully found a rare cannabinoid that has a high affinity for the human CB1 receptor through simulation together with python and machine learning models
- Visualized protein similarities through hallucinations using python, PyMol and knowledge in organic chemistry
- Produced a technical outline with a multidisciplinary team across Canada that organized and summarized biological findings to satisfy real-world demands for potential companies to explore

### Multidisciplinary Undergraduate Research Competition
**Technologies:** R, Matlab, Latex, Word  
- Analyzed and statistically compared the market's data for air purifiers in order to lower costs, increase efficiency, and safety for incoming products for COVID-19
- Interpreted how ultraviolet air purifying works, specifically with \( TiO_2 \) together with multi-walled carbon nanotubes, which reduce the harmful effects of UV radiation
- Transformed our findings into digestible content by using python and matplotlib

## Technical Skills:

- **Languages:** Python, Java, C/C++, R, MATLAB, LaTeX
- **Developer Tools:** Visual Studio, IntelliJ, Git
- **Libraries:** pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, scikit-learn

## Community Engagement:

### Undergraduate Research
**Advisor: Arman Hejazi, UBC Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering** - Vancouver B.C.  
*Sept. 2021 -- Aug. 2022*  
- Published an abstract with our findings which resulted in working towards a manuscript for an improved paper which is currently being organized

### Undergraduate Research Opportunities Club
**University of British Columbia** - Vancouver, B.C.  
*Sep. 2021 -- Aug. 2022*
- Advanced my knowledge in research by understanding how to read/write technical documents and give presentations
to a variety of audiences

## Publications and Conferences:

### Multidisciplinary Undergraduate Research Competition (MURC)
**University of British Columbia** - Vancouver, B.C.  
*March 2020*  

- Lead a multidisciplinary team as we discovered innovations in air purification which evolved into authoring an abstract and representing our findings in a non-technical presentation
