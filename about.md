## Profile:

My goal is to be a part of the innovative technology scene, leveraging my creativity and deeply rooted math and physics background to drive positive changes. During my recent role at a leading global fuel cell company, I worked in a multidisciplinary team and pursued many projects, from liquid injection molding to particle analysis. In this role, I learned to take initiative and lead in ambitious environments while consistently emphasizing my accountability and meaningful contributions.

## Education:

### 3rd Year UBC Engineering Physics, BASc
**University Of British Columbia** - Vancouver, B.C., Canada  
*Sept. 2021 -- Present*  
- Engineering Physics is the bridge between Engineering and Science combining advanced concepts in math and physics while putting them to practical use in team-based projects.
- Key Courses: software construction, signal processing, mechanics and instrument design

## Technical Experience:

### MEA Process Engineer Co-op, Advanced Manufacturing
**Ballard Power Systems** - Burnaby, B.C., Canada  
*Jan. 2023 -- April. 2023*  
- Applied a structured approach to qualify an automated robotic Liquid Injection Molding process involving data collection, capability/GR\&R analysis, and ultimately, a presentation of results in a lean Six Sigma environment.
- Hands-on experience in operating Liquid Injection Molding machines including troubleshooting and control over molding parameters.
- Developed and implemented automated data analysis in excel, transforming raw data into actionable insights; increasing overall efficiency by 98%.
- Accelerated production times by 75\% through a combination of rapid prototyping 3D printed fixtures designed in Creo and updates to vision measurement system routines in C++.
- In-depth knowledge on the manufacturing and development of fuel cells

## Technical Projects:

### Autonomous Driving Robot Competition: 2nd Place
**Technologies:** CAD, Machine Shop, C++  
- Brainstormed, designed, and manufactured an autonomous robot with a group of 4 to race on the same track as other robots while passively picking up and avoiding objects.
- Created the entire chassis, ensuring all sensors, circuits and mechanical components function as intended, quickly prototyping drawings into reality by using 3D printers and laser/waterjet cutters.
- Implemented and tuned a PID algorithm in C++ so the robot can follow tape smoothly through custom-made tape sensors controlled by an STM-32 Blue Pill.

### Nand2Tetris: Project Course
**Technologies:** HDL, Gate logics, Git  
- Designed digital logic circuits using Hardware Description Language (HDL), combining various logic gates and sequentially developing larger components of a modified computer system.
- Developed an understanding of computer architecture by building a modified computer system from the NAND gate up; learning knowledge of CPU architecture, ALU design, and memory systems.

### Canadian Synthetic Biology Education Research Group, SYNB3
**Technologies:** Python: scikit-learn, NumPy, pandas  
- Assisted in the identification of a cannabinoid that has a high affinity for the human CB1 receptor.
- Modeled protein similarities through hallucinations using Python, PyMol, and knowledge of organic chemistry.
- Produced a technical outline with a multidisciplinary team across Canada that organized our results to satisfy real-world demands for potential companies to explore.

### Multidisciplinary Undergraduate Research Competition
**Technologies:** R, Statistical Methods: Hypothesis Testing  
- Analyzed and statistically compared market data of air purifiers using R to lower costs and increase the efficiency and safety of incoming products for COVID-19.
- Interpreted how ultraviolet air purifying works, specifically with TiO<sub>2</sub> together with multi-walled carbon nanotubes, which reduce the harmful effects of UV radiation
- Transformed our findings into digestible content by using Python and Matplotlib to be shared in a conference.

## Technical Skills:

- **Prototyping Tools:** 3D printing, laser/waterjet cutting, SolidWorks, OnShape, oscilloscopes, soldering
- **Languages/Systems:** Python,  C/C++, Java, Matlab, R, Linux, ROS
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, OpenCV

## Community Engagement:

### Engineering Physics Mentor
**University of British Columbia** - Vancouver, B.C.  
*Sept. 2023 -- Present*
- Guided 5 first-year students in Engineering Physics, providing academic support and career advice
- Developed strong leadership and teaching skills through this role

## Publications and Conferences:

### Multidisciplinary Undergraduate Research Competition (MURC)
**University of British Columbia** - Vancouver, B.C.  
*March 2022*  

- Authored an abstract and represented our findings in a non-technical presentation.
