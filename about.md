## Profile:

I have one year of engineering industry experience working with electromechanical systems, mechanical design, and root casue analysis for biomedical and manufacturing applications. With those skills, I have created user-facing parts for large CAD assemblies with technical drawings, in-house testing applications, and jigs. Recently, I created an official plugin for the note-taking app Obsidian called [*Image Collector*](https://github.com/tdaykin/obsidian_image_collector), which now has over over 2K+ downloads. In school, my team and I are working on our capstone project, developing an edge AI chip for low-latency inference.

## Education:

### 4th Year UBC Engineering Physics, BASc
**University Of British Columbia** - Vancouver, B.C., Canada  
*Sept. 2021 -- Present*  
- Engineering Physics is the bridge between Engineering and Science combining advanced concepts in math and physics while putting them to practical use in team-based projects.
- Key Courses: software construction, signal processing, mechanics and instrument design.

## Technical Skills:

- **Prototyping Tools:** SolidWorks, 3D printing, laser cutting, soldering, Arduino, STM32, KiCad, FPGAs.
- **Programming:** Python, Linux, R, Matlab, C++.
- **Libraries/Frameworks:** Onnx, PyTorch, OpenCV, ROS, NumPy, Pandas, PySide6.

## Technical Experience:

### Instrumentation Engineer Co-op
**Cytiva** - Vancouver, B.C., Canada  
*May 2024 -- Dec. 2024*  
- Identified and solved a short-circuiting risk through root cause analysis, designing a machined aluminum part to improve device safety working with engineering teams and project managers.
- Developed an RFID reading tool to quickly diagnose 100% of RFID tagged products using an Arduino and custom software in C++.
- Designed and prototyped user-facing parts for large biomedical device CAD assemblies with technical drawings.

### MEA Process Engineer Co-op, Advanced Manufacturing
**Ballard Power Systems** - Burnaby, B.C., Canada  
*Jan. 2023 -- April. 2023*  
- Hands-on experience operating Liquid Injection Molding machines including troubleshooting and optimization of molding parameters through data collection and analysis.
- Decreased production times by 75% through a combination of rapid prototyping 3D printed jigs  and updates to vision system routines.
- In-depth knowledge on the manufacturing and development of fuel cells.

## Technical Projects:

### “Image Collector” plugin for Obsidian
**Technologies:** Open Source, TypeScript, JavaScript, CSS 
- Created an Obsidian approved plugin with 2K+ downloads to automatically extract and organize images from markdown files.
- Actively engaged in user feedback and led 4 different version releases.

### Self Driving Car Agent
**Technologies:** ROS, Gazebo, CNNs, DAgger, Keras 
- Developed and trained a CNN model using imitation learning and DAgger to navigate an autonomous robot around a Gazebo environment with ROS.
- Optimized data collection and preprocessing to improve robot performance and reduce model size by over 90%, increasing performance accuracy.

### Autonomous Driving Robot Competition: 2nd Place
**Technologies:** CAD, Machine Shop, C++  
- Brainstormed, designed, and manufactured an autonomous robot with a group of 4 to race on the same track as other robots while passively picking up and avoiding objects.
- Created the entire chassis, ensuring all sensors, circuits and mechanical components function as intended, quickly prototyping drawings into reality by using 3D printers and laser/waterjet cutters.
- Implemented and tuned a PID algorithm in C++ so the robot can follow tape smoothly through custom-made tape sensors controlled by an STM-32 Blue Pill.

### Nand2Tetris: Project Course
**Technologies:** HDL, Gate logics, Git  
- Designed digital logic circuits using Hardware Description Language (HDL), combining various logic gates and sequentially developing larger components of a modified computer system.
- Developed an understanding of computer architecture by building a modified computer system from the NAND gate up; learning knowledge of CPU architecture, ALU design, and memory systems.

### Canadian Synthetic Biology Education Research Group, SYNB3
**Technologies:** Python: scikit-learn, NumPy, pandas  
- Assisted in the identification of a cannabinoid that has a high affinity for the human CB1 receptor.
- Modeled protein similarities through hallucinations using Python, PyMol, and knowledge of organic chemistry.
- Produced a technical outline with a multidisciplinary team across Canada that organized our results to satisfy real-world demands for potential companies to explore.

### Multidisciplinary Undergraduate Research Competition
**Technologies:** R, Statistical Methods: Hypothesis Testing  
- Analyzed and statistically compared market data of air purifiers using R to lower costs and increase the efficiency and safety of incoming products for COVID-19.
- Interpreted how ultraviolet air purifying works, specifically with TiO<sub>2</sub> together with multi-walled carbon nanotubes, which reduce the harmful effects of UV radiation
- Transformed our findings into digestible content by using Python and Matplotlib to be shared in a conference.

## Community Engagement:

### Engineering Physics Mentor
**University of British Columbia** - Vancouver, B.C.  
*Sept. 2023 -- Present*
- Guided 5 first-year students in Engineering Physics, providing academic support and career advice.

## Publications and Conferences:

### Multidisciplinary Undergraduate Research Competition (MURC)
**University of British Columbia** - Vancouver, B.C.  
*March 2022*  

- Authored an abstract and represented our findings in a non-technical presentation.
